# Image-Colorization
Automatic CNN based machine learning model that colorizes black and white images

Used LAB color space and predicted A & B values for the images instead of 3 in case of RGB, applied L2 loss function as it was giving highest accuracy.

Used Pre-trained VGG-16 model for semantic information and image characteristics.
